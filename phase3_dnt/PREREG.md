# Driven, Not Tracked — pre-registered criteria (committed before each experiment runs)

Both repositories: branch `driven_not_tracked`. All new outputs: `/raid/ubx858/outputs/dnt/`. Test splits are never used
for tuning or checkpoint selection; checkpoints are selected on 3DPW validation as before.

## Track A — PEAR-free student (fairness control)

**Registered 2026-10-15, before the smoke test and the full run.**

- **Model and schedule:** the L-real recipe (ViTPose-S backbone, PEAR head architecture, 128,000 steps, batch 64 = 38
  BEDLAM2 + 13 UBody + 13 COCO/MPII, lr 3e-4 / backbone x0.1, warm-up 1,500, cosine to 5%, bf16, seed 20261009, the same
  augmentation, 3DPW-validation every 2,000 steps, `best.pt` by validation PA-MPJPE), with **no PEAR anywhere**: no
  teacher weights loaded, no distillation or feature terms (`configs/dnt/student_pearfree.yaml`, `teacher_checkpoint: none`).
- **Supervision:** BEDLAM2 SMPL-X GT (unchanged terms); COCO/MPII 2D keypoint loss through the detector-fitted vertex
  regressor with hips re-enabled; UBody SMPL-X pseudo-GT (root, body, valid hands; lower body only where `full_body`)
  + UBody 2D keypoints; no shape / camera terms on UBody rows; **no face supervision** (expression, jaw, eyes) in this run.
- **EMA:** decay 0.9995 per step; the EMA weights are validated at every validation and saved in every checkpoint. The
  reported Track A checkpoint is the EMA weights at the step of the best (live) validation PA-MPJPE, unless the EMA
  validation at that step is worse by more than 0.3 mm PA-MPJPE, in which case the live weights are reported — this
  choice is made on validation only and stated in the report.

**Keypoint regressor (pre-step).** Fitted on BEDLAM2 training renders (ViTPose+ small, COCO expert) against the GT
meshes; evaluated on BEDLAM2 validation renders against the same detector.
- **Pass:** mean detector distance (torso units) of the hips and of the shoulders down by **>= 50%** against the current
  SMPL-X keypoint mapping. If it fails, the 2D loss keeps the current mapping with hip weight 0 (as L-real) and the
  failure is reported; the run still proceeds.

**Primary criterion — "circularity answered":** the PEAR-free student is within
- **1.0 mm PA-MPJPE** and **2.0 mm MPJPE** of L-real on **3DPW test** (author's protocol, `tools/eval_author_protocol.py`,
  the same evaluator SHA as every Table-3 row), and
- **0.01 COCO PCK@0.05** of L-real (author's protocol, COCO val 4,648 persons).

Reference values (L-real, measured): 3DPW test 74.51 / 48.75 mm; COCO PCK@0.05 0.772. All three conditions must hold.
Secondary (reported, not gated): LSP-Extended PCK, EHF (PA-PVE all / hands / face, body PA-MPJPE), standard 3DPW test,
and the same numbers for the live (non-EMA) weights.

**Interpretation registered in advance.** Pass -> the student's gains over earlier checkpoints are not an artefact of
distilling PEAR (PEAR is not needed to reach them). Fail -> PEAR distillation contributes beyond the labels; the gap
is reported per metric and no further tuning of the PEAR-free run is done in this phase.

## Track B — C1 live-driving gap (G1)

To be registered in this file before B4 runs (after B1–B3 are prepared).
